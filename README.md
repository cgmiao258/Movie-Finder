I am currently a graduate student studying Computer Science at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. This website was created as a summer project for 2023. I wanted to combine elements of python, CSS, HTML and SQL together in order to create a project.  It has pushed me into doing my own research and coming up with solutions to the problems that were presented.
